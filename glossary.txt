script:
  A file that contains some code. Code can be in python or other languages.

function:
  Group of lines of code that can be called multiple times. Reasons why:
    - By making a group of lines, you can give it a name that makes it easy to
    remember and read later.
    - You can also avoid repetition.

parameters and arguments:
    ```
1.  def dummy_function(p1, p2):
2.      ....

5.  number = 10
6.  dummy_function(number, "hello")
    ```
  In the above code snippet, p1 and p2 are parameters. number and "hello" are
  arguments.

  variables in function definition are called parameters.
  variables or values used when calling a function are called arguments.
  dummy_function takes two parameters p1 and p2. (Line 1)
  dummy_function is being passed two arguments number and "hello". (Line 5)
